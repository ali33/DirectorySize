# DirectorySize
One C# application that find the biggest directories in one selected directory

I wrote this app when I want find some app to stats size of directories in my latop. I'd found https://windirstat.net/ but it is slow and some time error. 

This app is written with C# and open Source; It's small app and run with .NET 4.6.1 or higher and (important) it  is very light!
